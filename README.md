## Features
- __Config Based:__ Insanely easy to configure to any variety of use cases.
- __Performant:__ All aspects were designed with performance in mind.
- __Small API:__ With only a few methods, there's not much to learn.
- __Fault Tolerant:__ Can specify several outputs at once.

## Example
```go
exporter, err := xflows.NewExporter("config.yaml")
if err != nil {
    logger.WithError(err).Fatal("Failed to create XFlows exporter")
}

exporter.ListenFlows(program.SFlows)
```
Yes, it is literally that easy.
